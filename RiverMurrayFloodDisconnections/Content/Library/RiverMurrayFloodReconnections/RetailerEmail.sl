The customer has been advised they will need to engage an electrician to complete relevant work before reconnection can occur.\\n\\nFor re-energisation SA POWER NETWORKS will require an eCoC on site after electrical repairs are performed and a Retailer requested reconnection service order.\\n\\nThe range of work required to be completed by the customer's electrician will be varied and could range from minor (e.g. general inspection and site testing to ensure safe reconnection) to major (e.g. replacement of customer wiring and equipment - which may include the customer switchboard).\\n\\nMFN's - it is expected that during the reconnection of some sites, a meter bypass will be required so customers get power restored as soon as practicable. Where this is the case, a B2B MFN will be sent to the Retailer to inform them that they will need to engage the relevant MP ASAP to complete the required metering work (please note this will be for any meter type).\\n\\nAbolishment's - it is expected that some customer may determine that a reconnection is not possible and wish to abolish the current supply to the property. Where this is the case, the customer will be required to request their current Retailer to raise a B2B Service Order Abolishment to SA Power Networks (please ensure you have considered this process given these sites are likely to remain in a disconnected status - both physically and within MSATS).\\n\\nThere were no service charges applied for the period the property was disconnected.\\n\\nIf you believe there have been charges added that should be waived, please contact the SA Power Networks B2B Team (b2b@sapowernetworks.com.au).\\n\\n{nmi}     {address}     {retailer}     {dateofAttendance}\\n\\nThanks,\\nSA Power Networks\"\r\n            sendEmail = True\r\n        elif source == \"Consumption Found Report\" and dateActioned != None and retailerEmail != None and emailedRetailer == None and dateofAttendance != None:\r\n            dateofAttendance = dateofAttendance.replace(\"T\",\" \")\r\n            dateofAttendance = dateofAttendance.replace(\"Z\",\"\")\r\n            body = f\"Hi Team\\n\\nPlease be advised that consumption has been recorded at the below listed properties.\\n\\nThis site(s) has now been turned back on in our system to capture any further consumption.
